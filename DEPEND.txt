The c++ boost shared library is required. To be specific, the "system", "filesystem", "program_options", and "thread" boost libraries. The "shcoind" and "shcoin" programs are the only sharelib program that link against boost libraries. To install on linux run 'yum install libboost*' or 'apt-get install libboost*'.

The 'openssl version 1.0.1g' distribution has been included in the directory '/depend/openssl-1.0.1g'. This version will automatically be compiled and linked against the shcoind and shcoin programs.

You must install the 'gcc-java' package in order to provide the "jni.h" gcc header file for the java API to compile correctly. To install on linux run 'yum install gcc-java' or 'apt-get install gcc-java'.

SWIG is optional. Pre-built source code has been generated as part of the distritution. To install on linux run 'yum install swig' or 'apt-get install swig'.
