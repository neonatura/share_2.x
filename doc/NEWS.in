v2.26 Share Library Suite
--
External device frame-work has been introduced in order to support card readers, barcode scanners, gps devices, "net clocks", FPGA, and other devices.

Support for the "MagTek" HID card read has been introduced. Card reads broadcast non-private information to clients in order to provide additional factors of authentification.

The "share log daemon" has been wrapped into the "share daemon" for conveience. Configuring a build with "--enable-debug" now prints logging to the standard error output and suppresses shlogd from being executed.
